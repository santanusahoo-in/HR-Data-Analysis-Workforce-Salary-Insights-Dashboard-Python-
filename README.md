# HR Data Analysis: Workforce & Salary Insights Dashboard

## üìä Project Summary
This project focuses on analyzing HR data to uncover actionable insights about the workforce ‚Äî including employee distribution, departmental performance, salary trends, and demographic diversity.  
Using Python, Power BI, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly, the analysis explores how salaries and employees vary across departments, genders, and locations, helping HR teams make data-driven decisions.

## üí° Business Problem
Human Resource departments often manage scattered employee data across systems and spreadsheets. Without structured analysis, decision-making around hiring, retention, and salary benchmarking becomes slow and reactive.

**Problem Statement:**  
How can HR data be analyzed to identify patterns in salaries, gender representation, departmental performance, and workforce growth trends to guide better business decisions?

## üéØ Objectives
- Clean and integrate HR employee data for consistent analysis.  
- Evaluate total and average salaries by **department**, **state**, and **gender**.  
- Identify high-cost departments and regions driving payroll spending.  
- Track hiring patterns and headcount growth over time.  
- Visualize pay distribution to detect potential gender or regional disparities.  
- Deliver clear and interactive visuals for executive decision-making.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of employees by gender, department, and location.
   - Salary comparison across genders and departments.
   - Correlation between hire date, salary, and department size.

3. **Visualization & Reporting**
   - Used **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** for visuals.
   - Built KPI visuals for Power BI dashboard integration.
